**zero_day**
: *zero_day* is my first repository as full-stack engineer using **Vagrant**
Steps I followed:
: * Navigated to my home directory
: * Created a directory *zero_day*
: * Navigated to this new directory
: * Initialized git and added the remote origin
: * Created this **README.md** with vi and wrote it using [Markdown](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/)
